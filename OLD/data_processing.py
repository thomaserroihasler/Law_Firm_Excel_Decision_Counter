    Extracts decision and case information from a given title string.

    This function searches for patterns that match legal decisions and cases,
    formatted as 'CAS/TAS YYYY XXX NNN', where 'CAS' or 'TAS' are decision
    prefixes, 'YYYY' is a year, 'XXX' is a series of letters, and 'NNN' is a number.
